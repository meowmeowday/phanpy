This is an alternative web client for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

- üè¢ **Production**: https://phanpy.social
  - `production` branch
  - break less often
  - slower fixes unless critical
- üèóÔ∏è **Development**: https://dev.phanpy.social
  - `main` branch
  - may see new cool stuff sooner
  - may break more often
  - may be fixed much faster too

üêò Follow [@phanpy on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@phanpy) for updates ‚ú®

Everything is designed and engineered following my taste and vision. This is a personal side project for me to learn about Mastodon and experiment with new UI/UX ideas.

## Features

- üë™ Multiple accounts
- ü™ü Compose window pop-out/in
- üåó Light/dark/auto theme
- üîî Grouped notifications
- ü™∫ Nested comments thread
- üì¨¬†Unsent draft recovery
- üé†¬†Boosts Carousel‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
- ‚ö° Shortcuts‚Ñ¢Ô∏è with view modes like multi-column or tab bar
- #Ô∏è‚É£¬†Multi-hashtag timeline

## Design decisions

- **Status actions (reply, boost, favourite, bookmark, etc) are hidden by default**.<br>They only appear in individual status page. This is to reduce clutter and distraction. It may result in lower engagement, but we're not chasing numbers here.
- **Boost is represented with the rocket icon**.<br>The green double arrow icon (retweet for Twitter) doesn't look right for the term "boost". Green rocket looks weird, so I use purple.
- **Short usernames (`@username`) are displayed in timelines, instead of the full account username (`@username@instance`)**.<br>Despite the [guideline](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/guidelines/#username) mentioned that "Decentralization must be transparent to the user", I don't think we should shove it to the face every single time. There are also some [screen-reader-related accessibility concerns](https://twitter.com/lifeofablindgrl/status/1595864647554502656) with the full username, though this web app is unfortunately not accessible yet.
- **No autoplay for video/GIF/whatever in timeline**.<br>The timeline is already a huge mess with lots of people, brands, news and media trying to grab your attention. Let's not make it worse. (Current exception now would be animated emojis.)
- **Hash-based URLs**.<br>This web app is not meant to be a full-fledged replacement to Mastodon's existing front-end. There's no SEO, database, serverless or any long-running servers. I could be wrong one day.

## Subtle UI implementations

### User name display

![User name display](readme-assets/user-name-display.jpg)

- On the timeline, the user name is displayed as `[NAME] @[username]`.
- For the `@[username]`, always exclude the instance domain name.
- If the `[NAME]` *looks the same* as the `@[username]`, then the `@[username]` is excluded as well.

### Boosts Carousel

![Boosts Carousel](readme-assets/boosts-carousel.jpg)

- From the fetched posts (e.g. 20 posts per fetch), if number of boosts are more than quarter of total posts or more than 3 consecutive boosts, boosts carousel UI will be triggered.
- If number of boosts are more than 3 quarters of total posts, boosts carousel UI will be slotted at the end of total posts fetched (per "page").
- Else, boosts carousel UI will be slotted in between the posts.

### Thread number badge (e.g. Thread 1/X)

![Thread number badge](readme-assets/thread-number-badge.jpg)

- Check every post for `inReplyToId` from cache or additional API requests, until the root post is found.
- If root post is found, badge will show the index number of the post in the thread.
- Limit up to 3 API requests as the root post may be very old or the thread is super long.
- If index number couldn't be found, badge will fallback to showing `Thread` without the number.

### Hashtag stuffing collapsing

![Hashtag stuffing collapsing](readme-assets/hashtag-stuffing-collapsing.jpg)

- Any paragraphs, except the first one, with more than 3 hashtags will be collapsed.
- If there are text around or between the hashtags, they will not be collapsed.
- Collapsed hashtags will be a single line with `...` at the end.
- They are also slightly faded out to reduce visual noise.
- Opening the post view will reveal the hashtags uncollapsed.

### Filtered posts

- "Hide completely"-filtered posts will be hidden, with no UI to reveal it.
- "Hide with a warning"-filtered posts will be partially hidden, showing the filter name and author name.
  - Content can be partially revealed by hovering over the post, with tooltip showing the post text.
  - Clicking it will open the Post page.
  - Long-pressing or right-clicking it will "peek" the post with a bottom sheet UI.
  - On boosts carousel, they are not partially hidden, but sorted to the end of the carousel.

## Development

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build
- `npm run fetch-instances` - Fetch instances list from [instances.social](https://instances.social/), save it to `src/data/instances.json`
  - requires `.env.dev` file with `INSTANCES_SOCIAL_SECRET_TOKEN` variable set
- `npm run sourcemap` - Run `source-map-explorer` on the production build

## Self-hosting

This is a **pure static web app**. You can host it anywhere you want. Build it by running `npm run build` and serve the `dist` folder.

Try search for "how to self-host static sites" as there are many ways to do it.

## Tech stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) - UI library
- [Valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/) - State management
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routing
- [masto.js](https://github.com/neet/masto.js/) - Mastodon API client
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) - Icon library
- Vanilla CSS - *Yes, I'm old school.*

Some of these may change in the future. The front-end world is ever-changing.

## Backstory

I am one of the earliest users of Twitter. Twitter was launched on [15 July 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter). I joined on December 2006 and my [first tweet](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/1298723) was posted on 18 December 2006.

I know how early Twitter looks like. It was fun.

Back then, I [made a Twitter clone](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/789031599) called "Twig" written in Python and Google App Engine. I almost made my own [Twitter desktop client](https://github.com/cheeaun/chidori) written in Appcelerator Titanium. I [gave one of my best talks about the Twitter client](https://www.slideshare.net/cheeaun/story-of-a-thousand-birds) in a mini-conference. I built this thing called "Twitter [Columns](https://twitter.com/columns)", a web app that shows your list of followings, your followings' followings, your followers, your followers' followers and so on. In 2009, I wrote a blog post titled ["How I got started with Twitter"](https://cheeaun.com/blog/2009/04/how-i-got-started-with-twitter/). I created [two](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/1273422454) [themes](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/1487781343) for DestroyTwitter (a desktop client made with Adobe Air by Jonnie Hallman) and one of them is called ["Vimeo"](https://dribbble.com/shots/31624). In 2013, I wrote [my own tweets backup site](https://github.com/cheeaun/tweets) with a front-end to view my tweets and a [CouchDB backend](https://github.com/cheeaun/tweet-couch) to store them.

It's been **more than 15 years**.

And here I am. Building a Mastodon web client.

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Notice to all other social media client developers

Please, please copy the UI ideas and experiments from this app. I think some of them are pretty good and it would be great if more apps have them.

If you're not a developer, please tell your favourite social media client developers about this app and ask them to copy the UI ideas and experiments.
